                  Animation Shop 6
		--------------------

Create 3D models with the following features:

Expand, Group, Play, Copy, Rotate, Bend, Create
Customize, Render, Animate, Import, Zoom, Flip

Help and examples included.

This program is not complete. If I went on the way
i'm going, it'll never be complete. This is because
I keep adding new features as I think of them. Yeah,
theres things I want to add, like keyframing for
example, but thats not going to be till I make a key
frame driven 3D engine, which won't be untill I....

It goes on, and this program never gets finished. So
you can have it now, as it is. Its pretty good. I finx.

Apparently someone else has a program of the same name
on PSC. This is a different program, if you don't like
it, sue me.

There arnt any exes in this zip file, but I sugest you
compile the two *.vbp files, one for the editor, on for
the help program, then place them in the folder containing 
all the *.am5 files. You can then run the EXEs, for
convenience. 

If you like this program, you can make it better by
assigning the *.am5 file type to the Animation Shop
EXE. You can then double click on a am5 file to open
it.

To get proper help, go 'Help' 'Help' on the menu. It
should actually help you a bit, I hope.
